Welcome to Software Crafters Manila!

More than anything, good Software Engineering is essential to building quality software. This group provides a venue for passionate Software Engineers to get better at their craft.

What happens at this meetup? We'll code!
Each session we'll set a specific skill or practice to learn and a problem to match, from TDD to Design Patterns to Clean Code. We'll then build a solution with other attenders by pairing ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming ) or mobbing ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming ) on it.
But we're also exploring other ways that fit whatever topic the group will find useful whether that does involve code dojos, or discussions done in open space or fishbowl. If you have suggestions, feel free to reach out.

If you're looking for a venue to practice skills you've learned or you just want to meet and work with other Software Engineers looking to continuously improve their craft, come join us!

Meetups are held at Metro Manila, Philippines, and are currently supported by [PageUp People](https://www.pageuppeople.com/).
