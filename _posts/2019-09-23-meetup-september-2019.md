Software Crafters Manila had our September meetup last September 18th. **PageUp People** hosted at [Work.able coworking office spaces](https://workable.ph/) in Ortigas CBD, Pasig.

We went with a more familiar meetup format with [Ealden Esca√±an](https://agilephilippines.org/@ealden) giving a talk on Specification by Example. We even had a game to illustrate the effect of cutting corners in software development.

After that the group spent the remainder of the evening to have some discussions on takeaways from the topic and shared that back with the larger group.
