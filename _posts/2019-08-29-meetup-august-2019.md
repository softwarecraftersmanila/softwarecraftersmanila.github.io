Software Crafters Manila had our second meetup last August 20th. **PageUp People** hosted again at Emapta's office in Ortigas CBD, Pasig. The date would usually be on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, but 21st was a holiday.

We were still covering Test-Driven Development, and picking up from last meetup we thought it would be good to cover a familiar kata to work with the group so we went with Roy Osherove's [String Calculator Kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1).

One feedback from last time was that there was a little difficulty with working in groups so we dialed down to just doing some pair programming. We attempted to split the time into 30 minute segments like we did the first time, but most everyone just wanted to see the problem through than restart. There were some who were completely new to testing, and didn't have the tools for it yet. [Cyber Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/) really helped us here to get a quick environment for getting tests going.

Here are some photos from the meetup.

We went a little over the time we had the room reserved while the group opted to extend another half hour to squeeze more time in to work through the problem so we moved to a different area.

Around 9:15 pm we wrapped up with a quick retro of what people found useful in the format we just ran, and then went for a group photo to close it out.
